# Size Limit

It is possible to limit the maximum size of your assets by type and compression. It ensures bundle quality over time.

## Check size

You can add size checks in `files` section of your configuration.

```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "test": "*",
      "maxSize": "250 kB"
    }
  ]
}
```

A check is composed by threw properties:

- `test`: a glob expression to match assets name
- `maxSize`: the maximum size of the asset
- `compression`: the compression used to compare the size (by default "none")

## Check several compressions

To check several compression, just add a rule with a specific compression. The following rule will check all JS file without compression and with "gzip" compression:

```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "test": "*.js",
      "maxSize": "250 kB",
      "compression": "none"
    },
    {
      "test": "*.js",
      "maxSize": "10 kB",
      "compression": "gzip"
    }
  ]
}
```
